# Espressif Extra Arduino Libraries

This repository houses and maintains certain Arduino libraries outside of the [Espressif Systems](https://github.com/espressif). Since the [Espressif Registry](https://components.espressif.com/) offers numerous components developed based on [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), encapsulating these components with C++ makes it very convenient for people to utilize their functionalities with Arduino.

The libraries are developed using [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) and have been uploaded to the [Arduino Library Manager](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry). This means they can be easily downloaded directly within the Arduino IDE.
